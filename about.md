# About page

This page tells you a little bit about me.
I grown up in Rizhao, a quiet tiny town in Shandong Province, China. It's a new city building along the coastline. When I was a little child ,I liked to lay on the beach and overlook the sea sparkling under the flame of sunset. All the old storys about youth and love, courage and cowardice, summer and winter... happened here. 

Pls follow my blog which updates at irregular intervals and listen to my telling tales. 

My dream is to create Alita.

Well, if you want to know my professional skills, you can [see my resume](/assets/cv_4.pdf) directly here.
